Back Propagation Neural Network Implementation done for the Neuronal And Evolutionary Computing subject.

### Exercise statement

#### Objective
Prediction  of the  power  of  the  turbine  of  a  hydro-electrical plant,  using  the Back-Propagation (BP) algorithm, implemented by the student.

#### Data
- File: turbine. txt
- Columns: 4 variables, 1  value to predict
- Variables: Height above sea level, Fall, Net fall, Flow 
- Prediction: Power of the turbine
- Patterns: 451 patterns
- Training and Validation (and cross-validation): the first 401 patterns
- Test: the remaining 50 patterns

#### Evaluation of prediction error
